Somethings I've learned about Machine Learn and Deep Learning.

## Description

This is a series of topic related to Machine Learning and Deep Learning which I am currently working on.
By the way, in this time, I am also reading a book that I found very interested and most of knowledge covered in 
this series is from it. It is [Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras & TensorFlow, Third Edition](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/hands-on-machine-learning/9781098125967/)
. In my opinion, this book is firmly helpful to someone who recently start on AI like me. It provides basic and also advanced
neccesary knowledge and skills on this field, like it's title: "Concepts, Tools, and Techniques to Build Intelligent Systems". However,
for whom just started reading academic books, It seems extremely boring and difficult in the beginning which can make you give up. Thus, my advice is
taking a glance each chapter before you start reading it, taking notes and writing a overview are helpful as well. I hope you have a good experience with this book,
I will begin this series from **Chapter 4: Training Models**, I've made 2 repos: [House Price Prediction](https://github.com/nminhquang380/housePricePrediction) and 
[Classification](https://github.com/nminhquang380/classification covering 2 previous chapters.
